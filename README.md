# MC-Modpack
this is just a folder with Minecraft Parasites Modpack, Open Modular, Dynamic Trees and Industrial Craft2. I created it for that my Friend to download it and play with me these mods on my Minecraft server

If you want to create a Minecraft server youself just go to https://ploudos.com/.
If you want to play with mods its better to install Curse Forge and login into your Minecraft account.
If you want to create a Server with Mods in it just use the Forge client. You can select it while you create the MC server on ploudos.
Mayabe the server doesnt support the newest version of the mod and you wont be able to play on your server, thats why you shiuld download the mods and upload it to the server.

If you done this just open Curse Forge and select the Modpack. Its important that youre using the same mods as the server. not more not less

Have fun
